            <p>Welcome to the land of questions
                Welcome to the isle of lore
                Where the veil came crumbling down
                There it all began, the germination
                Unveiling a cryptic door
                There it was revealed, hopes and aspirations
                Unclosing an enthralled door
                Escalate the sense
                Enhancing to join the dawn
                I close my eyes, Inis Mona
                And reminisce of those palmy days
                I moon o'er you, Inis Mona
                As long as I breathe, I'll call you my home
                20 years I have walked your barrows
                Years of emulous youth
                I followed the path of the wise
                There it all was sown, the inspiration
                Removing the seven seals
                There it was revealed, enigma and freedom
                Unclosing an unseen door
                Escalate the sense
                Enhancing to join the dawn
                I close my eyes, Inis Mona
                And reminisce of those palmy days
                I moon o'er you, Inis Mona
                As long as I breathe, I'll call you my home</p>
